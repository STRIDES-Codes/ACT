## Introduction
Improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability is a key component in moving towards greater reproducibility in computational biomedical research. For the past six years, NCBI Codeathons (formerly NCBI Hackathons) have generated more than 300 computational tools and software packages in its GitHub repositories. As the number of repositories increases, it has become more challenging to find, access, use and reuse these very useful tools.  

In this project, we developed **A**utomated **C**ontainerization **T**ool (ACT) to automatically create a Dockerfile or a Docker image for R- and Python-based repositories using an open-source tool [Dockta](https://github.com/stencila/dockta), which also leverages standard vocabularies to enable greater discoverability of these tools. Containerization is the process to package software code along with all the dependencies needed to run that code allowing that application to be deployed reproducibly on any platform.  By encapsulating the entire analytical environment using containers, ACT can be implemented for any individual or organizational GitHub repositories to further improve the findability, accessibility, itneroperability, and reusability of these tools.

## What is ACT?
ACT or **A**utomated **C**ontainerization **T**ool is a Python package that leverages the container image builder [Dockta](https://github.com/stencila/dockta) to automate the containerization of R- and Python-based GitHub repositories.

## Installation and Setup
### Docker image
**ACT** has a pre-built Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nciccbr/strides_act). Using the **ACT** Docker image is the simplest way to run **ACT**â€”you need only Docker Engine installed on your computer. Please follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker Engine.

Once Docker Engine is installed, **ACT** can be run as follows:

```
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v `pwd`:/data2 nciccbr/strides_act:v1.1.0 agct build --repo-url https://github.com/CCBR/AAsap.git --img-name ccbr_aasap --output /data2/AAsap
```

### Dockerfile

A local docker image can be built using the provided [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STRIDES-Codes/ACT/main/Dockerfile). You will need Docker Engine installed on your computer for building a Docker image. Please follow the instructions the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker Engine.

Once you have a local copy of the Dockerfile and you have Docker Engine installed, you build the docker image like this:

```
$ docker build -f Dockerfile --no-cache -t strides_act .
```
If all goes well, you should be able to list the Docker image *strides_act* using:
```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY    TAG    IMAGE ID    CREATED    SIZE
strides_act    <none>    32f43784742c    22 minutes ago    1.08GB
```

### Local install
If you wish to install a local copy of **ACT**, then you can run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STRIDES-Codes/ACT/VK/utils/autocontainer-setup.sh) in our repository. We highly recommend using our Docker image for running **ACT**.
